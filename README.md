# random-trading-bot
This trading bot selects a random stock and tells you whether to buy or sell.

The goal is to have this bot be able to read current investments (likely within Robinhood) as well as the current S&P500 stocks, and randomly buy or sell one of these stocks 0-3 times a day (with protections to avoid being marked as a day trader).
